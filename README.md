## Design Motivation
Since Holloween is coming this weekend, we would like to design LED patterns that fit this theme. We will present the pumpkin pattern with a single orange LED and a ghostface pattern with a single red LED. Initially, the orange LED will be lit. Once the button is toggled, the orange LED will be off, and the red LED will be on. The yellow and red LED will be on when the button is toggled again. If we push the button the third time, the patterns will repeat.
(Update when doing lab) The red LED is not bright enough. For demo propose, we are now using an orange and a blue LED instead.
